Cedar: Copyright and License
=============================

The Cedar Framework (or simply Cedar), is being developed
collaboratively with members of the Applied Mathematics and Plasma
Physics Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory and members of the
PSAAPII Center for Exascale Simulation of Plasma-Copuled
Combustion. To recognize each institutions role, and provide more
options for accepting external contributions to the code, each
institution has asserted copyright on its contributions, while
agreeing on a single open-source license, namely the three-clause BSD
license.  Terms of use, redistribution and modification, as well as
the disclaimer are given in the BSD license at the end of this
